  # The 2D scene has problems with lighting and with camera placement. <hint: A render-to-texture is maybe needed? >
  # When camera is placed on baricentrum, it will never point to origin again. 
  # The 2D scene has problems with camera on baricentrum <hint: a new 2D camera is maybe needed. This will solve also the problem 1 >
  # The pauses added by the scheduler are not perfectly equal to the actual time that a robot spends without moving. This results in a wrong behavior of the animation control slider.
  # The majority of the menu items do not work
  # Dragging in Switch Toggles sometimes does not work
  # In Follow The Leader algorithm, sometimes none of the robot moves
  # The animation control slider sometimes generates an Exception
