#summary Introduction to Sycamore

= Introduction =

Sycamore is a 2D-3D simulation environment for autonomous mobile robots algorithms. With Sycamore it is possible to test an algorithm as well as to check its behavior under several different situations.
Sycamore is an open source project, completely realized with Java.

= Details =

Sycamore is a completely modular system, where you can write your own plugin and insert it into the system. The available plugins are: 
  * Algorithms
  * Schedulers
  * Cost measures
  * Visibilities
  * Agreements on axes
  * Memories
  * Initial conditions

= References =
