= Features not yet implemented =

Here follows a list of features that are planned but not yet implemented in Sycamore:

  * The Agreement plugin is not yet supported. All coordinates in the system now are just global coordinates (there is full agreement on axes between robots). The support for this feature will be implemented soon.
  * The Measure plugin does not write its measured values anywhere.
  * The reporting System and plotting support are not implemented yet.
  * The support  for scheduled simulation is not available yet.
  * The visualizer is not available yet.

Here follows a list of known bugs. Please, feel free to let us know if you find a new bug

  # The 2D scene has problems with lighting and with camera placement. <hint: A render-to-texture is maybe needed? >
  # When camera is placed on baricentrum, it will never point to origin again. 
  # The 2D scene has problems with camera on baricentrum <hint: a new 2D camera is maybe needed. This will solve also the problem 1 >
  # The pauses added by the scheduler are not perfectly equal to the actual time that a robot spends without moving. This results in a wrong behavior of the animation control slider.
